# hc-sr04 neurobot case

A case for hc-sr04 ultrasonic sensor for Neurobot robotic construction set.

### What is this repository for?

* This case is designed for using in my construction sets because I haven't found appropriate one for me :) This case completely covers the sensor so children can't touch sensitive electrical parts. It is designed to be used with [Neurobot robotic construction set](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1457211)
* Version 0.1

### How do I get set up?

* The case is designed using OpenSCAD.
* Deployment instructions: just clone the repository, enter the folder and open the main.scad file. In the end of the file choose the appropriate model (case, cover, or both) by uncommenting the desirable line. After that just render (F6) and export the choosen model to stl-file.
* if you want to build the case with Lego module (hcsr04_holder_case), you should use [Robotic parts for children](https://github.com/alsprogrammer/Robotic_parts_for_children). Just clone it, unpack and copy parts.scad and bitbeam_constants.scad to your working directory.

### Who do I talk to?

* Repo owner is Alexander Sayapin (http://alstutor.work)
